	The Jaguar C Library.

0.5.7
-----
	Added definitions of TOM & JERRY registers.

0.5.4
-----
	Addition of this ChangeLog file.

	Changed the memory allocator to use the one of Doug Lea which is a
	public domain piece of code.  The benefits are obvious since now,
	we are using a well tested and fully featured memory
	allocator (memalign/realloc in particular).
