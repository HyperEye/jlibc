<h1>The Atari Jaguar C library</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">0.5.2 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_sec">
Introduction</a></h2>
This is the documentation of the Atari Jaguar C library. This library is intended to implement eventually a full ANSI C library. It has been especially targeted for the Atari Jaguar since some parts are written in assembler and takes into account some specifities of this platform. In addition, this C library contains the source of a generic startup code for the Atari Jaguar (crt0.s).<h2><a class="anchor" name="Installation">
Installation</a></h2>
The easiest way to install this library is to get your hands on a binary distribution of it. Then copy the header files in a directory where your C compiler will look after (include directory) and the objects and archive files in a directory where your linker will look after (lib directory).<p>
Provided that your compilation environment is correctly set up, you can also alternatively build the library with the 'make' command and then install it where you want with the 'make install' command. You might have to change the TARGET variable of the Makefile to indicate where you want all the files to be copied.<h2><a class="anchor" name="license_sec">
